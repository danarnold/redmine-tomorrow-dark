# redmine-tomorrow-dark

A flat dark color scheme based off the base16-tomorrow dark color palette. It's
not the prettiest, but I think it's easier on the eyes than the bright white of
standard Redmine.

Only tested with Redmine 2.5-stable.

As always, THANKS to Chris Kempson for the [base16 color palettes](http://chriskempson.github.io/base16/)!
